## Feature Of this Side

- On the homepage, you will find six food items displayed. These items are arranged based on the quantity available, with the ones having a larger quantity placed at the upper portion of the page. Additionally, there is a "See All" button that, when clicked, will allow you to view all available food items. 

 - When a user logs in, they gain access to the "Add Product" route. In this section, they can input all the necessary information for adding a food product to the platform. This process allows users to contribute their own food items to the platform, enhancing the variety of available products.

 - In the "Manage Food" route, users can access a table that lists the food items they have added. This table provides various actions:

Delete: Users have the option to delete a food item from the list. Clicking the "Delete" button removes the selected item from their list of added foods.

Edit: Users can edit the information of a food item. This allows them to update details such as the product's name, quantity, description, brand, and other relevant information.

Check Status: Users can check the status of the food items they've added. This may include reviewing any pending or accepted requests related to those items.

Accept Request: If there are pending requests for a specific food item, users can accept these requests. Upon acceptance, the food item is no longer displayed in the available food section, as it has been assigned to the requester.

These features provide users with the ability to manage and control the food items they've added, as well as handle requests from other users interested in those items.

 - When a user makes a food request, that food item is displayed on their "My Food Requests" page. This page allows users to keep track of the food items they have accepted by  food provider or not. Users also have the option to cancel their request if it has not been accepted by the food provider.
